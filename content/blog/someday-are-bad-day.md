# Life is hard isn't it?

Someday are hard and you have to deal with it. You can't give up. You can't lose yourself. You gotta be strong.
#
Day by day, is a new day. You need to keep up. it's not always easy, but nobody said it was.
#
One day you'll need to kick some asses, but the other day, all you'll need to do is breathe and enjoy everything around you. Every day is a different day.
#
Sometimes I ask to myself what I'm doing or what's the purpose of this? Honestly, I can't find the naswer. I feel lost, I feel blessed. I feel sad, I feel happy.
#
One thing I learned about all those moods is: it's okay not to be  okay, it's okay if you don't have all the answer. But please, don't treat anyone bad just because you aren't well. You don't really know what's going on with the other one. You can change your day. You can change a day. Just don't ruin the other's day just because you're not okay. Feel the pain, just don't make the pain.
#
Everything is going to be okay. It's just a bad day. Breathe, it's fine.
